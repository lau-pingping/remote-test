Make use of Enumeration and Abstraction for the implementation for different Operator. The current design allow expansion of other mathematic operator to be easily implemented.

The current implementation does not cater for formula with combination of "* or /" operator and "+ or -" operator, eg. (12 + 4 * 5 - 6 ). However, it won't be difficult to be implemented as the similar approach of handling formula with "( )" and be applied.
